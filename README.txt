To run Deseq2, just for convenience. I renamed the matrix of gene counts generated by Salmon to GeneCounts.csv (.txt to .csv)
 and 
csv file containing metadata/phenotype information to Pheno.csv.

## to reduce the runtime: I should have used vst() instead of rlog() but I didn't.


I tried to incorporate shiny in the R markdown just for curiosity to see iff it works.  Please ignore the part.

app. R is a single shiny file that has all code to run the app. Please use this to run shiny app.

Input files:

results2.csv (final results)

expression.csv (intermediate file)

The app displays box plots as instructed.

Please run the app.R file after setting the working directory. The input files, and app.R should be in the same folder.
